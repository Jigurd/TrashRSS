# Known Issues
Currently quite incomplete. Ran into a problem which as far as I can understand with my admittedly limited knowledge boils down to certain parts of the JDK not existing in Android.
If you want the error in question, uncomment the one line in OnResume in MainActivity under "the broken stuff".

What actually is there works pretty well, though! :P
